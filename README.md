## Forecasting no of Users Logging In for a website.
### ðŸ’¡Objective
##### To forecast number of users that will login to handle resources.In this project, it has been showcased the main concept of forecasting using ARIMA model. ARIMA model is one of the forecasting methods used mainly for time series analysis and predictive analysis.In Data Science, ARIMA model is one of the important model methodogy used for creating highly impactful models that generates solutions based on time series analysis. The data that has been used for this project is taken from Kaggle.
###  ðŸ’¡Data Introduction
##### On describing the data in jupyter notebook python , plot for increasing years with number of users suggest that there are yearly increase in number of users logging in from 2019 - 2022. Business organisation that wanted to quantify how business is performing , this shows that the business performance is going in an upward directions with increase in users logging in yearly.The average number of users on yearly basis has been increased from 2019 that sugests us that business performance could rise and organisation's performance might increase with increase in web traffic.

|  |Year|Average number of users|
|:-:|----|        :--:            |
|0  |2019|54.405479               |
|1  |2020|65.453552               |
|2  |2021|76.164384               |
##### With increase in Web traffic, load to the website will also increase that might increase in overall cost of handling websites in cloud.Business might need a right amount of scaling provisioned inorder to meet the demand of the web users.

###  ðŸ’¡Data Trend Analysis to forecast
##### The plot below , signifies the yearly trend with number of users logging in on a daily basis.

##### With respect to plot and data that was updated on recent years, it was found that there was number of users that logging in for the year 2021-22 was changing frequently in up down trajectory, and similar trends was found with other years/Months with change in numbers. With this finding we can conclude that the data is not distributed in a trend and might be influenced with seasonality. In order to forecast that data we will need to proceed with checking the seasonality in the data.

##### Decomposing the data multiplicatively and additively will define on what trend users are logging in to websites. It will also gives us trend in which the data is flowing on, it defines that the users are influenced by seasonality while logging in to the website. As there is a data changes its trajectory in upward direction on yearly , keeping decomposition factor to year will give data trends. The plot below shows yearly seasonality trends, when data is being decomposed multiplicatively and additively keeping the factors of little more than year.

##### It can be inferred that data is in an upward trajectory trends, influcencing seasonilty. In addition ad fuller test indicates the data present are stationary or non - stationary. Stationary data signifies that the mean and variance present in the data do not change over time. After conducting Ad Fuller test, it was found that data is non - stationary in nature and differencing will be required. Differencing will make data stationary as shown in the plot below.
![1st Diff](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5256bbae-e85a-4360-a48e-ce15f6a8b5ad)
##### Since the p value for 1st Differencing identified as 5.674175568009798e-26  for Ad Fuller test ,by rejecting the null hypothesis we can come to a conclusion that data is stationery and can proceed with generating the predictive Model.

###  ðŸ’¡Constructing Predictive Model for Forecasting
##### In Order to generate ARIMA model for Forecasting we will need Autocorrelation factor or ACF and Partial Autocorrelation PACF. On generating the ACF plot and values for 1st differencing data, it was identified repetitive high on 7th Lag signifying seasonality.
![ACF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb8207d-c71b-4a7a-8f06-5ae5f9d0a220)
##### Whereas PACF gives negative high on 5th, 6th and 13th Lag which results in PACF value close to 5,6 or 13.

##### Data Preparation in training and testing phases can be acheived by splitting the data in 80-20% giving total observation for Training and Testing with 878 and 219. 
##### With differencing as 1st Differencing, ACF keeping as 1 and PACF starting with 4 gives a decent ARIMA model summary that justifies the model suitablity for finding forecast on WebUsers login.Developing the ARIMA Model in training dataset and checking for white noise with LB Test gives us less pvalue where null hypothesis is rejected and absence of white noise is achieved. where as in JB test P value increased , Null hypothesis cannot be rejected giving data stationarity.Also heteroskedasticity p value is lesser, rejected null hypthesis and giving variance is present in the training data set .
##### Diagnostics plots for ARIMA model,Simple Quntiles shows that the model residuals is Linear in nature as the data points is near to the line. Histogram shows that the model residuals values is well distributed with mean near to 0. The Correlogram has 7lag as highest point shows seasonality in the training Data Model.

##### Adding seosonality to the training ARIMA Model, better performance can be achieved with greater effieciency. On Adding the Seasonality and checking the diagnostics plots, Correlogram lag is reduced .

###  ðŸ’¡Performance Metrics of Forecasting Model

|DataSet|MSE|RSME|Seasonality|
|:----:|-----|----|:---:|
|Train|195.41|13.98|NO|
|Train|84.08|9.17|Yes|
|Test|172.90|13.14|Yes|

##### Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error are considered to be the best performing metrics when forecasting model are developed. After training the model and evaluating the model performance with respect to training data set ,ARIMA model without seasonality is having more MSE and RMSE when compared to ARIMA model with seasonality. Hence ARIMA Model with seasonality provides better results and more accurate forecasting values for Webusers logging in. The Plot shows how well the model is performing in testing dataset with actual and predicted values.

### ðŸ’¡Conclusion
##### When applying the trained model to Testing Dataset it was observed that Mean Absolute Error of 10 approximately giving Percentage Error of 15%. Hence we can conclude that with 15% error ,forecasted web users will login to the websites.Based on the this forecasted users Business can achieve its performance targets and scale up the resources accordingly.
##### The forecasting plot shows 60 days forecast having MAE of 10 users.
